   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Grasp Planner Configuration File
========================================================

The grasp planner aims to be highly customized, and this customization is done using the configuration file, that is typically stored in the config folder of your package.
The YAML format is used for this file for better understanding and readability.

Due to the huge number of parameters that can be tweaked, the parameters can be divided into the following subgroups, where explanation of each parameter will be provided

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   grasp_planner_parameters_general
   grasp_planner_parameters_finger

Sample configuration yaml file
-------------------------------
If you are unsure of how to begin writing a yaml file, the following is an example of the full configuration of the yaml file.
