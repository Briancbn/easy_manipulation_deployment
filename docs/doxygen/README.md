# Easy Manipulation Deployment API 
Welcome to the Doxygen page for the easy_manipulation_deployment suite

This package was tested with the [easy_perception_deployment](https://github.com/ros-industrial/easy_perception_deployment) ROS2 package, but any other perception system that provides the same ROS2 message in the right topic can work with this package as well. 

It is recommended to run this package on **ROS2 Foxy**.
